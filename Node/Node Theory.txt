Node.js: is an open source, cross-platform javascript runtime environment.

1. open source: source code is publicly available for sharing and modification(github)
2. cross-platform: (operating systems) available for Mac, Windows and Linux. 
3. javascript runtime environment: provides all the necessary components in order to use 
		and run the javascript program outside of the browser.

ECMAScript: 
	
	1993, first browser with UI, Mosaic
	
	1994, lead developers of Mosaic founded a company called Netscape
		and a polished version of Mosaic was released with the name 
		"Netscape Navigator" (it only supported static pages)
	
	1995, Netscape created their own scripting language called JavaScript.
		(the name JavaScript was only for marketing purpose)
	
	1995, Microsoft released their own browser Internet Explorer
		Microsoft developers reverse-engineered the Netscape Interpreter and 
		created their own scripting language called JScript
	
	Developers have to label the website with "Best viewed in Netscape Navigator"
		"Best viewed in Internet Explorer"
		
	1996, Netscape submitted the JavaScript to an organization called "ECMA Internationals".
		It is an org which standardizes the information and communication system.
	
	ECMA provided a standard specification and a committee for javascript -> "ECMAScript"
		Specification -> ECMA-262
		Committee 	  -> TC-39
----------------------------
ECMAScript versions: 

	1997: ECMAScript - 1
	1998: ECMAScript - 2
	1999: ECMAScript - 3
	2009: ECMAScript - 5
	2015: ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)
	
==========================================================================================

JavaScript Engine:	it is a program which converts JS code to machine code.
	Each browser vendor has their own JS engine.
	
	Ex:
		âœ” V8 --> Google for Chrome
		SpiderMonkey -> Mozilla Firefox
		JavaScriptCore -> Apple for Safari
		Chakra -> Microsoft for Edge (original)
				Modern Edge uses V8 engine
				
V8 Engine: is written in C++ --> it is great for low level tasks such as
		file handling, networking, database connection.
		

Node.js Source Code 
	deps -> dependencies --> v8(engine), uv(operating system) / libuv, etc...
	scr  -> (source code / main code) -> C / C++ featuers
	lib  -> JS library -> js code --> internally communicates with C++ code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Browser v/s Node:

	Browser: 
		we interact with the DOM
		Web plaform API --> Cookies
		document, windows, etc...
		
	Node:
		we get the access to APIs provided through modules
		developer can control the environment

Module: is an encapsulated and reusable chunk of code that has its own context(scope)
In node js, each file is treated as a separate module.

	Type: 
		1. Local --> by me
		2. Built-in -> by node
		3. Third-party -> by some other developer, used by me
		
	By default, modules are isolated

#Local Module: the modules which we create and use in our application.
	--------------------------------------------------------------
	NOTE: we follow CommonJS module format for import and export
